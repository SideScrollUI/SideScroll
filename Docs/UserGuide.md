## Widescreen monitor recommended

SideScroll automatically displays all entries in a recursive Parent->Child->Sub-Child...and will keep going until it hits the edge of your screen or an object that can't be expanded. Because of this, entries can easily get to be 10-20 levels deep. SideScroll does include some autoscrolling capability, but it really shines with a widescreen monitor. It's much easier to use when everything is visible at once.

## Theming
- You can switch between Light & Dark mode in the Settings, as well as define your own custom theme
- Themes can be shared as json by clicking the export & import buttons
