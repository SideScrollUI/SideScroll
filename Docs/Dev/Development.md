# Development

## Getting Started
Before getting started, it might help to see some of the different things you can do in SideScroll. The Sample app includes lots of example tabs to help get you started.
```
git clone https://github.com/SideScrollUI/SideScroll.git
cd SideScroll
dotnet build
dotnet run --project Programs/SideScroll.Start.Avalonia/SideScroll.Start.Avalonia.csproj
```

## Avalonia UI
* SideScroll is based on the [Avalonia UI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) library, so be sure to also check out that library for custom controls and more advanced behaviors.
