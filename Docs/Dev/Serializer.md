# Serialization

Atlas includes it's own serializer, which allows it to load gigabytes of data in a few seconds.
## Features
- Automatically serializes any object passed to it. No extra logic is required.
- All public Fields and Properties are automatically serialized
- Serialization is binary (MUCH faster than JSON serialization)
- Circular references are supported
- If you declare a property as virtual, you can load objects in a lazy manner. If you set `lazy` = `true` when loading the deserializer, it will create a wrapper class that will only load the virtual properties when referenced (subsequent references don't reload the data)
  - `public virtual string reallyLongString { get; set; } = "...";`
  
## Limitations
- You must add a default constructor if you add a constructor with parameters
```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public MyClass() {}
    public MyClass(int param) {}
}
```
- Renaming fields or changing the object type will cause the default value to be loaded instead
  - Will probably add an attribute for renaming fields/properties at some point
- There is probably a 2 GB file limit due to array limits in .Net. This hasn't been hit yet, but will probably require some slight refactoring in the serializer to handle it as the database size grows.

## Object Cloning

You can call the Serializer.DeepClone<Type> to do a deep clone of any object that can be serialized. Additionally, any class with a [Static] will not be cloned to speed things up (useful for objects that won't change). This can be useful for simulating things where 90% of the data doesn't change and you want to take snapshots at intervals.

## Restricting Types
- When importing or exporting data like bookmarks, you might want to restrict which data can be exported
- When calling any SerializerMemory method, you can set `publicOnly = true` to disable exporting any data without the `[PublicData]` / `[ProtectedData]` attribute
- Currently, when serializing or deserializing, the debug output will print a warning whenever it encounters a type without a `[PublicData]`, `[ProtectedData]`, or `[PrivateData]` attribute. A warning log entry will also be added.
- `[PublicData]`
  - Any type or class members that specify this attribute will be included
- `[ProtectedData]`
  - All class members will default to [PrivateData], but can be overridden with a [PublicData]
- `[PrivateData]`
  - Any types or class members that specify this attribute will be ignored, and the debug output will not output a warning for them
- The following types are also allowed
  - `string`
  - `DateTime`
  - `TimeSpan`
  - `Type`
  - `object` (exact type or any allowed type only)
  - `List`
  - `Dictionary`
  - `HashSet`
- Any other types will be skipped
